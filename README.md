## Introduction
In this project I have implemented Style transferm (Model used - VGG19):
1. Using Pytorch
2. Using Tensorflow
3. From Scratch (Mathemetical Model)

## Example (NST folder)
This is my image

This is the style image

This is the image after style transfer (run for 20 iterations)

![final](https://github.com/kushagra1198/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/master//NST/output/me20it.jpg)

This is the image after style transfer (run for 100 iterations)

## Example (Tensorflow code)
This is an image I'll use to illustrate style transfer

This is the style image

This is the image after style transfer (run for 1000 iterations to produce the result (style bend parameters 0.8 & 0.2))
